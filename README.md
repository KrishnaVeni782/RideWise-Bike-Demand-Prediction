# 🚲 RideWise: Predicting Bike-Sharing Demand Based on Weather and Urban Events

## 📌 Project Description
RideWise is a Machine Learning project that predicts bike-sharing demand based on weather conditions and urban events using historical data.

## 🎯 Objective
To help bike-sharing companies forecast demand and manage bike availability efficiently using data-driven prediction.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Machine Learning (Linear Regression)

## ⚙️ Features
- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Bike demand prediction using weather inputs
- Model evaluation using MAE and R2 Score
- Visualization of Actual vs Predicted Demand

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install required libraries:

2 2. Run the project: python ridewise.py

  ## 📊 Output
- Predicted bike demand
- Performance metrics (MAE, R2 Score)
- Graph visualization of predictions
